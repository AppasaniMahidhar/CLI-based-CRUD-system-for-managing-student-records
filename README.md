# CLI-based-CRUD-system-for-managing-student-records
This Java CLI program manages student records using CRUD operations. It defines a `Student` class with ID, name, and marks, and uses an `ArrayList` to store student objects. Users can add, view, update, or delete students through a menu-driven interface. It's simple and effective for practice.
